"""Mastermind — the coherence architecture for systemprompt.py.

How does the agent follow the prompts in systemprompt.py *inevitably*,
with zero enforcement, zero coercion, zero policing? By making the prompt
the coherent center of every request. Nothing forces the model — the
structure simply leaves nothing else to follow.

Three cooperating mechanisms, all deterministic Python (rung 1):

  PromptVault          Every prompt is sealed at startup with a sha256
                       fingerprint and recorded in the event log. The
                       vault is the ONLY source a prompt is ever read
                       from — a prompt that was never sealed cannot reach
                       a model.

   PromptGate           The single door to the model. Every request —
                        main agent, worker — passes gate.dispatch(),
                       which guarantees messages[0] carries the sealed
                       prompt (byte-for-byte prefix) and seals a
                       prompt.dispatch lineage event. If the prompt is
                       missing or shadowed it is simply re-seated — an
                       integrity restore, like a checksum, not a penalty.

  CoherenceComposer    The advanced piece. Dynamic context (goal, memory,
                       constitution, web mode) is never appended as raw
                       text that could compete with the prompt. It is
                       COMPOSED into one coherent document: the sealed
                       prompt stands first as the constitution, and every
                       context section is explicitly framed as *input to*
                       that constitution — provenance-tagged, ordered,
                       deduplicated. The model follows the prompt because
                       everything else in the message points back at it.
                       Coherence, not coercion.

There is no enforcement layer, no injection policing, no output contract
auditing. The system observes and records (PromptLineage) — it never
punishes. Every dispatch is sealed into the event log; the lineage IS the
proof of what the model saw.
